				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Abyss are high-ranking lesser demons from the deepest levels of the netherworld that manifests through blood. Since they use blood as their medium, they can materialize and liquefy at will, manifesting as somewhat of a teleportation skill that allows them to dissolve into a solid surface and reappear somewhere else. Abyss truly resemble what in pop culture is understood as a "demon:" a red humanoid with horns and a long, spade-tipped tail. Their bodies are red just in part, since they seem to be white but covered in blood. They possess three spike-like protuberances growing out of their backs, and wield magic scythes that can regenerate the blade even after this is thrown away.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Arachne resemble giant spiders with blade-like forearms. They come in white or green varieties, with the green version having tougher carapaces in addition to a larger size. Both can shoot sticky webbing out of their mouths and spinnerets in order to ensnare their victims.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Blood-goyle is a lesser demon that appears in Devil May Cry 3, and is created when blood touches certain enchanted statues. They are first encountered in Mission 5: Of Devils and Swords when Jester fills a fountain with blood, which animates the ornamental statues in it. The blood left behind after Dante knocks one into a wall forms the number 5.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Damned Pawn is the weakest of the Chessmen, but often appears in great numbers that can allow it to overwhelm its enemy. Like a real pawn, it can only move forward one space (two spaces on its first movement), but attacks by swiftly uncrossing its swords to the spaces immediately diagonal to it. If it reaches the other side of the Damned Chess Board, it will be promoted to either a Damned Knight, Damned Bishop, Damned Rook, or Damned Queen. Fake Pawns also appear throughout the tower.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Damned Knight is faster and stronger than the pawn, but still not much of a threat. Like a real knight, it can only move in an L-shaped motion. It jumps very high during this movement, and spears the ground when it lands. It can attack during this movement, or by swinging its horn at nearby enemies.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Damned Bishop is slow, but its magical skill makes it a potent support piece. Like a real bishop, it can only move diagonally. It can summon a ring of fire which it focuses into arrows and shoots down its lanes of movement, or it can summon a small vortex of wind that heals it and nearby pieces. However, it is considered more dangerous than the Rook (see below), because the fireballs it shoots will spin around it at first damaging the player if close enough or trying long combos against him. Fake Bishops also appear throughout the tower.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Damned Rook is also slow, but is very powerful and can summon other pieces. Like a real rook, it can only move horizontally or vertically, but it can also switch places with the Damned King when it castles. It attacks by opening up its body and firing lasers down its lanes of movement.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Damned Queen is the most powerful of all the Chessmen, and so she only appears on the Damned Chess Board. Like a real queen, she can move in any direction, diagonal or straight, and is very swift in her movements. She attacks while she moves, making her very dangerous, but she lets out a cackle before moving that serves as a warning, and her path is illuminated with violet smoke. She will let out a groan once defeated.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Damned King is the most important piece because he controls all the others. Like a real king, defeating it will end the game, and so he only appears on the Damned Chess Board. If attacked, he will attempt to castle and switch places with any Damned Rook, or will open up his core, before unleashing an extremely powerful blast of energy around him to halt his attackers. Like a real King, it can attack and move to the spaces immediately adjacent to itself. It should be noted that the Damned king piece seems to be based on Mundus himself.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Dullahan's only form of attacking includes stabbing using the rotating spikes attached onto the shield, and slashing airborne enemies with its sword. The effectiveness of its armor prevents all forms of frontal attack; its only weakness being the red gem embedded into its spine.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>As its name implies, Enigmas are mysterious looking creatures. Featuring only one eye, they have honed their aiming skills, and utilize them when firing upon their enemies. Using their six arms to create energy bolts, the Enigma are archer-like creatures, and also possess strong armor to prevent them being thrown off guard by light gunfire.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>A Fallen is so named because she fell from angelic grace for deceiving her victims. She covers herself with her beautiful wings, which act as an impenetrable shield for the face on her vulnerable abdomen, and wields a lance of light.[1] This lance can be thrust into enemies like a spear, or thrown like a javelin. If hurled at distant enemies, it will explode shortly after striking the ground. Although The Fallen is female, her voice is notably masculine.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Soul Eater is created from the spiritual remnants of the rage of murdered demons. It will usually manifest as a cloud of blue smog, but if one shows his back to it, or slashes at the smog for long enough, it will manifest as an octopus-shaped monster. In this shape, it will try to dive at its target and grab him within its tentacles before feasting on his soul.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Hell Pride is the weakest of the seven Hells, and it governs those who committed the sin of pride. However, the Hell Pride makes up for its weakness with numbers. They are slow and are easily defeated.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Hell Envy manifests through a mysterious green bile, which restricts their movement but prevents them from being knocked into the air. It governs those who committed the sin of envy, and can only be found within the body of Leviathan. They wear a few bandages about their faces, like a torture mask. They attack similar to the Hell Pride, but disappears in a liquid instead of sand when defeated. </p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Hell Wrath is the most miserable of the seven Hells, it governs those who committed the sin of wrath. It is forced to carry a massive organic sack that explodes when dropped or damaged, taking out anything close to it, and often shrieks in pain. It is best to hang back and use firearms to destroy them.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Hell Sloth is the tallest of the Hells, governing those who committed the sin of sloth. It does not walk, but instead only teleports around to ambush its victims. It moans before teleporting; an audio cue to watch out for when fighting them. Though slow, their attacks are powerful. They are best dealt with using the shotgun and Cerberus.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The governor of covetous souls, The Hell Greed cannot directly attack its victims, so instead it uses its beloved coffin to summon Hell Prides, Sloths, and Lusts to fight for it. However, it can injure its victim if he gets in the way of the coffin while it is summoning. Although annoying, keeping these enemies around makes for an easy way to upgrade your Stylish Rank.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Hell Gluttony, the governor of those guilty of gluttony, is similar to a Hell Pride, but is slightly stronger and able to fire a blast of sand from its mouths that can injure its victims. Unlike Hell Prides, it wields a sharp double-bladed staff. It is best dealt with using Artemis. Staying behind it also offers protection from its sand blast.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Hell Lust is similar to a Hell Pride, but is much faster and able to not only dodge and weave to avoid attacks, but also perform an extremely fast dash attack. However, it lacks the numbers of the Hell Pride. It governs those who committed the sin of lust. It wears a distinctive jester-like outfit rather than bandages or a cloak. Their dash attacks can be easily blocked with a well-timed Royal Block or countered with Stinger. Beowulf or Spiral are good choices to use against them.</p>
