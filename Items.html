				<p>The Holy Water is a vial of divinely blessed water. It appears in all games, and if used it will fend off demons and severely damage any that are near the player.

				<p>Red Orbs are magical red stones consisting of the crystallized blood of demons. Throughout the game, the amount of Red Orbs the player finds during a mission factors into its final grade. They are usually found by defeating enemies and breaking objects, and in the game they are given as rewards for completing missions. The amount of orbs obtained by defeating enemies depends on the Stylish Rank at the moment they are defeated, and the amount obtained by completing a mission depends on the overall mission grade. Red Orbs also function as the in-game currency, and in the game they can be used to purchase items, weapon upgrades, and new abilities at Divinity Statues</p>
